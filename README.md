Welcome to FastStats!
This gem is for computing stats in an efficient manner.
It manages a collection of arithmetic and geometric means to help reduce the
[data clump code smell](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/data-clumps).

To experiment with the gem, clone it, run `bundle install` and then
`bin/console` for an interactive [pry](http://pryrepl.org/)
 session (a great Ruby REPL).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fast_stats'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fast_stats

## Usage

### `FastStats::Mean`

Build up the arithmetic and geometric means for a metric.

#### Initialize

```ruby
mean = FastStats::Mean.new
```

#### Instance Methods

**`add(val) ->  value`**<br>
    Adds the `val` to the mean and returns the new `n` (count). <br>
    Alias: `<<`.

**`arithmetic -> value`**<br>
**`arithmetic round: val -> value`**<br>
    Returns the current arithmetic mean.

**`geometric -> value`**<br>
**`geometric round: val -> value`**<br>
    Returns the current geometric mean.

**`summary ->  hsh`** <br>
**`summary round: value ->  hsh`** <br>
Returns a Hash with the arithmetic and geometric means.

#### Example

```ruby
mean = FastStats::Mean.new name: "foobar"
10.times { |i| mean << i }  # or mean.add(i)

puts mean.arithmetic
# => 4.5

puts mean.arithmetic round: 2
# => 4.5

puts mean.geometric
# => 3.597297064377001

puts mean.geometric round: 3
# => 3.597

puts mean.summary
# => {
#   "arithmetic"=>4.5,
#   "geometric"=>3.597297064377001
#   }

puts mean.summary round: 3
# => {
#   "arithmetic"=>4.5,
#   "geometric"=>3.597
#   }
```

### `FastStats::Means`

Collect means for multiple metrics:

#### Initialize

```ruby
means = FastStats::Means.new
```

#### Instance Methods

**`add(metric_name, val) ->  value`**<br>
Adds the `val` to the `name` mean and returns the new `n` (count) for that
mean. <br>

**`summary ->  hsh`** <br>
**`summary round: value ->  hsh`** <br>
Returns a Hash of each mean's summary.

#### Example

```ruby
# Say you have some "post_fetcher" that is an enumerator for your posts.
means = FastStats::Means.new

post_fetcher.each do |post|
   # do stuff with post
   means.add "likes", post["like_count"]
   means.add "comments", post["share_count"]
end

means.summary
# =>
#{
#   "likes_arithmetic"=>4.888888888888889,
#   "likes_geometric"=>3.345423581422162,
#   "comments_arithmetic"=>13.636363636363637,
#   "comments_geometric"=>7.1824970648723765
#}

# You can also pass a round: value
means.summary round: 2
# =>
#{
#   "likes_arithmetic"=>4.89,
#   "likes_geometric"=>3.35,
#   "comments_arithmetic"=>13.64,
#   "comments_geometric"=>7.18
#}

```

## Change Log

Changes and plans for future changes can be found in [the Change Log](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
 `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
 prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file
to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
